### Summary 

 Graduated from Izhevsk state technical University (correspondence Department) with a red diploma. But I believe that the color in this case shows not the quantity and quality of the knowledge received, but the ability of the student to find solutions and achieve the set results. 
 
 I consider myself an organized person. I appreciate accuracy and harmony. Ready to work hard to show my full potential and change my life for the better.
